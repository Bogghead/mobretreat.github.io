A DAY OF MOB RETREAT
===================

Participants are split in Mobs with size of 5 +- 1.

Schedule
-------------

The retreat consists of 4 to 5 rounds.
Each round takes about 75 minutes.

75 minutes * 4 rounds + 45 minutes lunch break = 5 hours 45 minutes
75 minutes * 5 rounds + 45 minutes lunch break = 7 hours

Each round starts with the 5 - 15 minutes introduction made by the retreat facilitator.

At the end of the introduction each participant should unterstand the objectives and the constraints of the round.

The introduction is followed by 2 x 20-25 minutes minutes of coding.

Each coding time is followed by 0-5 minutes retrospective inside each MOB where participants can share their observations, feelings and ideas.

At the end of each round there is 5-10 minutes long discussion round between all mobs.

All times are announced by the retreat facilitator.

After the discussion the mob rejoins, but one participant per MOB leaves his group and joins some other group so that in each MOB one person per round is replaced.

Rotations
-------------

A mob always has one driver, one navigator and the mobbers.

The roles are changed by ROTATION.

In the ROTATION DRIVER becommes MOBBER, NAVIGATOR becomes DRIVER, one of the Mobbers becomes NAVIGATOR based on some fix order.

There is a 3 minutes timer. 

After first 3 minutes NAVIGATOR MAY initiate a ROTATION.

The ROTATION MUST happen within the following 3 minutes. So there MUST be a ROTATION each 3 to 6 minutes. 

After each ROTATION the timer MUST be restarted.

Constraints
-------------

Now the most interesting part: the constraints are related to different styles of mobbing and navigating we have been talking about and I have experienced so far. The below descriptions are just drafts and suggestions to be discussed.

### Round 1: Strong Style Navigating

- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD tell DRIVER what to do based on his own ideas.
- The NAVIGATOR MAY ask MOB to give help and contribute suggestions.
- The rest of the MOB MAY NOT ask NAVIGATOR questions or offer suggestions before the NAVIGATOR request.
- The DRIVER MAY ask NAVIGATOR questions.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT offer ideas.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT type anything before being told by the NAVIGATOR.

### Round 2: Moderating Style Navigating

- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD tell DRIVER what to do based on ideas coming from the MOB.
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD always ask MOB to contribute suggestions.
- The DRIVER and the rest of the MOB MAY offer ideas and ask NAVIGATOR questions by raising hands.
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD moderate all discussions.

### Round 3: Free Style Navigating
